# SRMS_PROJECT
## Project Description

The Student Management System is a C++ console-based application that helps manage student records efficiently.
It supports three types of users — Admin, User, and Guest, each with different access permissions.
Admins can manage student data fully, while Users have restricted access, and Guests can only view details.

This system demonstrates file handling, data structures, authentication, and role-based access control, making it suitable for academic mini-projects or college submissions.
